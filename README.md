# Mad Libs using Ruby

This project was created by Sarah Graddy as a beginner-level project to learn Ruby. It was inspired by the classic Mad Libs game.

## How to Play

- Follow the prompts to enter words for each part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.).
- After all the words have been entered, the program will generate a funny story using the user's inputs.

## Customization

You can add your own stories by editing the main.rb file in the project directory.
